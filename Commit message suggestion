DOM Manipulation Lab - (my King xo) 

DOM Manipulation Lab — Recruiter and Recovery Ready
Author: Sophie Alice May Leslie Wallace Date: 18 Oct 2025 Purpose: Demonstrates DOM selection, dynamic content and style updates, event-driven interactivity, and user-input handling with vanilla JavaScript. Designed to be recruiter-facing, accessible, and auditable for recovery or legal provenance.

Files and how to run
Files included: index.html; script.js; style.css; ACCESSIBILITY.md; screencast.md; CHANGELOG.md; README.md (this file).

How to run: Clone the repo and open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). Interact: click Change Text, type into the input and click Submit.

Key highlights (one paragraph for recruiter)
Completed a timed DOM Manipulation Lab demonstrating element selection using getElementById and querySelector, dynamic updates to textContent and inline styles, event-driven interactivity via addEventListener, and secure user-input handling; includes semantic HTML, minimal responsive CSS, accessibility considerations, and a short screencast script for a 30–60s demo.

Accessibility checklist (essential)
Heading hierarchy: single H1 present.

Labels: input has a programmatic label (visually hidden).

Keyboard: all interactive controls reachable via Tab; visible focus styles applied.

Live updates: paragraph uses aria-live="polite" for screen-readers.

Contrast: ensure AA-level contrast for body text; use relative units for font sizing.

Testing: test keyboard-only navigation, VoiceOver or NVDA, and a contrast tool.

Screencast script (30–60s)
0:00–0:05 — Title: "DOM Manipulation Lab — Sophie Wallace." 0:05–0:15 — Show initial page state: H1 and paragraph. 0:15–0:25 — Click Change Text; show paragraph update and say it’s triggered by an event listener. 0:25–0:40 — Type into input, click Submit; show paragraph updating from user input. 0:40–0:50 — Open script.js and highlight selections, textContent changes, and addEventListener lines. 0:50–0:60 — Close with: "Demonstrates core DOM skills, accessibility patterns, and recruiter-ready code." Recording tips: deliberate cursor, clear narration, export MP4.
